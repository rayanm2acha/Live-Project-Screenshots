# Live Project Screenshots
 Screenshots of my work during the Tech Academy Live Project


During a two-week long Live Project I've had the opportunity to hack into an OWASP website running locally on docker, look into its database, change logins for admin, download secured hidde files.

I've also worked on malware traffic analysis, malware files, bad executables and other defensive forensics tasks.

I will keep uploading to this repo along my training in other sandbox environments.
